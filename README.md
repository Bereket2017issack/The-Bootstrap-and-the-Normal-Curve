# The-Bootstrap-and-the-Normal-Curve

##In this exercise, we will explore a dataset that includes the safety inspection scores for restauraunts in the city of Austin, Texas. We will be interested in determining the average restaurant score (out of 100) for the city from a random sample of the scores. We'll compare two methods for computing a confidence interval for that quantity: the bootstrap resampling method, and an approximation based on the Central Limit Theorem.
